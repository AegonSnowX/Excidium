# EXCIDIUM: The System Simulator

**This is School Project , Entirely for Educational Purpose Only and excercising our Skill in Alorithms and Data Structure.**

## ðŸ§  Overview

**EXCIDIUM** is a C++ terminal-based simulation inspired by the System from *Solo Leveling*.  
It acts like a digital judge, taking in real-world performance data (push-ups, planks, running) and translating it into RPG-style stats.

The player is assessed, ranked, and placed into a progression loop with plans to unlock quests, track progress, and evolve rank over time.

## ðŸŽ¯ What We're Building

We're building an actual **fitness-based stat and ranking simulator**, not just a fake game UI.  
You start by entering real performance data:
- Push-ups â†’ Strength  
- Plank â†’ Endurance  
- 5km Run â†’ Stamina

The System processes your input, converts it into numeric stats (0â€“100 scale), then ranks you from **E** to **Monarch** using a Binary Search Tree.

This gives every player a unique **starting rank** based on real-world ability.

After the assessment, the goal is to:
- Introduce quests that target weak stats
- Grow stats over time
- Re-evaluate rank as progress is made
- Build a narrative of **self-improvement through training**

## ðŸš€ Why Itâ€™s Cool

- It's **gamified real life**â€”the stats come from *your* performance.
- It uses **actual data structures** like Binary Search Trees to determine progression.
- We're merging **fitness and code** in a way that mimics real progression systems from RPGs.
- This is **not a clicker game**â€”itâ€™s a reflection of the userâ€™s effort.
- It's modular, so future additions (skills, enemies, evolution trees) can be added easily.
